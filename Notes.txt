AI Usage:

Used GitHub Co-Pilot running "Claude Sonnet 4.5" for the following:
- Initial project planning and defining folder/modules structure with __init__ files.
- First draft of every function with comments
- Analyse raw HTML from Eventbrite to identify tags for exctraction
- Write system prompts
- Fix defects
- Create testing scripts
- Write README.md file

Outputs were obviously supervised and needed to be iterated to achieve a working state, however, the main challenges which required most of my time were:
- Improve original data model for the fields I wanted
- Claude originally tried to use Eventbrite API which has been discontinued, understanding why it was not working and replace by webscrapping
- Fix all the fields parsing as the data quality of the original extractions was terrible - with help of another instance of Claude analyzing raw HTML
- Fix how to store location and allow for the Agent to be able to retrieve accurate results with both slug format and just the city - fixed multi-shot prompting to search for city only
- Added logic to skip duplicates in exctration for both existing records in DB and in the same batch
- Fixed imports and usage of Agno - original draft was halucinating a lot
- Fixed patterns to export methods between models - Claude is still lacking to keep the same patterns accross the project with duplicated and unnecessary code being created often
- Added logic to keep chat history when using Agno - originally it was just working with single message/answer
- Added tool to Agent to be able to execute autonomous scraping for new cities
- Fixed how to get details for a given event within the conversation context

Thoughts on things that can be improved:
- Obviously adding more sources apart from Eventbrite
- Webscrapping is faulty - Eventbrite discontinued the public search API but still has the Venues API, one idea would be to create a storage of Venue IDs per city and scrape the API by a list of Venue IDs for each city
- Category search only works with the actual names (e.g prompting the agent "wellness events" does not retieve the "health" category) - implement a vector DB for semantic search
- Improve web parsing by using an LLM to process the page when the fields are not in expected HTML tags
- Inside Eventbrite open more pages and scrape those instead of just looking to the dashboard per city
